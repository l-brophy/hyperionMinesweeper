this has been my favourite assignment from the hyperion software engineering bootcamp so far! I had a lot of fun
getting this one right, and it took me a couple of days to whittle it down to what it is now - I wasn't satisified
until the entire program (sans doc-strings) fit into my 13-inch laptop monitor. 

the assignment scope was given as follows:
demonstrate an understanding of 2D lists by writing a program that mimics a minesweeper solution: given a list of
lists where hashes represent mines and dashes represent normal tiles, print a solution showing how many mines are
adjacent to every tile.

where I think I shine:
- zero IndexErrors in all my tests and it only took 1 function to ensure that! 
- finding patterns and using them to shorten code
- making the program handle permutations of co-ordinates for me
- program can still handle itself if given a large map to generate
