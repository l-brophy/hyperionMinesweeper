my submission for HyperionDev's 2-D Lists and Data Structures assignment, which tasked us with writing a Minesweeper-like program that identified "bombs" vs. normal tiles in a grid, and updating the 2-D list with the number of "bombs" in the spaces adjacent to the normal tiles. I enjoyed this challenge very much, and elected not to use exception-handling for out of bounds errors, which helped me recognise the pattern in the bounds-check, which is correctly applicable to either axis. I intend to refactor this in my free time, so that I can properly gamify and optimise it!
